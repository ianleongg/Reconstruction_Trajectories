**Reconstruction of Vehicle Trajectories Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Generate data save in pickled file for visualization later
* Reconstruct trajectories and compared with pickled file

### README

- The generating data for visualization can be found [here](./Trajectories_Data_Generator.ipynb) and an example of accelerating and then turn 270 degrees left is shown:

- The data generated by previous step was save in a pickled file and used [here](./Reconstructing_of_Vehicle_Trajectories.ipynb) for comparison.

### Steps used for vehicle trajectories.

#### 1. Generate data.

* A Car class was initialized with various functions such as reverse, forward, steer, gas, go, etc.

  - 1st Manuever: 
   - accelerate and then turn 270 degrees left

  - 2nd Manuever: 
   - accelerate onto highway and change lanes

  - 3rd Manuever:
   - parallel parking

#### 2. Reconstuct trajectory data

* The raw input data is saved in pickled files and can be loaded using a [helper function](./helpers.py)

  - The data list loaded contains four fields, correspond to:
   - timestamp (seconds)
   - displacement (meters)
   - yaw_rate (rads / sec)
   - acceleration (m/s/s)

* The job is to complete [functions](./solution.py), all of which take a processed data_list (with ùëÅ entries, each Œîùë° apart) as input to reconstruction the vehicle trajectories.
